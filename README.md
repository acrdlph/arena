# Arena
This is an MVP for a personal curation market: Participants create their own bonding curve token which then allows token holders to direct the participant's attention and actions.

## Motivation
One of the main monetization models for content producers is influencer marketing. Content producers enter elaborate contracts with selected companies which require them to perform certain actions, say certain things and direct the consumers' attention to certain products. 
arena decentralizes and disintermediates this business model: it drastically reduced the transaction costs so that anyone can monetize their personal influence and attention resources directly through an open market.

## Mechanism

Content producers create their own bonding curve token and then allow token holders to vote on what should be included in the sponsored section of the content to be produced.
The bonding curve has differing buy and sell curves, and for every token purchase, the difference can be allocated to the content producer.
If content producers adhere to the voting results, the market will come to see the token as representative of the content's value for directing the attention of the content producer and her audience.
Anyone who wants to buy time/attention in the sponsored content of the content producer (in order to place a product, to ask a question, to request a song, to prioritize a topic etc.), can invest in token and influence the content.
Token holders are incentivized to vote for the sponsorship options that maximize not only their own return but also increase the popularity of the content, since that would increase the demand for the token and by the bonding curve mechanics allow token holders to sell at a higher price.
Content producers who are not yet influential can monetize future expected influence, if market participants speculate on the content becoming valuable later and therefore buy token early on.
